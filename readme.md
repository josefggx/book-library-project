# My Book Library

This project is a browser version of a Library or Book Collection. The purpose of the project was to practice with JavaScript objects and using prototypes. It was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

## Functionality

- The first thing we will find is a text section where we can see our statistics of read books and unread books, as well as the total number of books in our library.
- Once pressed, the add book button will display a modal/popup containing a form to add books to the library.
- This form will ask us 4 things: 
â€¢ The title of the book. 
â€¢ The author of the book. 
â€¢ The number of pages of the book. 
â€¢ Whether or not we have read the book.
â€¢ Also, the form will have an add book button to confirm the submit, and an exit button to cancel the operation.
- Every time a book is added to the library, a card will be created showing the information we collect in the form: Title, author, pages and reading status.
- It is important to add that each card belongs to a book individually, and that each one allows us two actions: 1. modify the reading status of the book. 2. remove the book from our library.
- The data of our library is stored locally on our device. In the future, I plan to use this project to learn about cloud storage. Another feature that I want to add in the future, is a "sort by" and a "search".

I've asked for feedback and opinions from people close to me, and one of the suggestions I've received for the project, particularly from my dear Ana, has been to add the possibility of giving the book a rating (with stars maybe), and also the possibility of adding comments and thoughts about the book on each card. 

## Learning Outcome:
I really enjoyed doing this project, to be honest, it made me fall in love with web development. So... My most valuable learning outcome, is that I absolutely love this. But, also:
I improved, in general, my knowledge of JavaScript, but I especially improved my abilities to interact with objects. I also learned a lot about prototypes, their importance and usefulness. I learned to use the data obtained from forms. And to store information locally.
Although I'm not a UI designer, it was fun to design the project on my own and honestly, I really liked the end result. I used Figma for this purpose.
I still have a lot to learn and this whole process excites me.
